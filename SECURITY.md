System Boundary
===============

The considerations in this document are primarily concerned with
flowgridviz itself and the adjacent systems with which it
communicates: principals 1-8.

Principals 9 and 10 (traffic sources and capture systems) are listed
as sources of potentially harmful content, but are well outside the
system boundary.

The labeling system is considered as a source and destination of
traffic from flowgridviz, but its handling of data from the capture
system and its interaction with its users, environment, etc., are not
considered. The safety of flowgridviz is not predicated on any
filtering property of the labeling system preventing harmful data
(such as from within a malformed packet capture) from reaching
flowgridviz. This is particularly important as flowgridviz is intended
as a security tool and will be exposed to packet and flow analysis
containing intentionally malicious data.

Similarly, underlying infrastructure such as power, DNS, IP routing,
and vm hosting are contemplated, but not assumed to operate in a way
that contributes positively to the safe operation of flowgridviz.


Adversary Powers Considered
===========================

1. Publish packet captures or packet flow files.
2. Send traffic to a system collecting packet captures or flow data.
3. Submit packet capture or flow files to flowgridviz
4. Submit HTTP requests to flowgridviz
5. Alter/Block/Spoof traffic between flowgridviz and an end-user or API-user
6. Alter/Block/Spoof traffic between flowgridviz and a data source host
7. Alter/Block/Spoof traffic between flowgridviz and the deployment system
8. Operate software on the same hardware as flowgridviz
9. Falsify DNS or routing information for any principal
10. Introduce vulnerabilities into software used by any principal
11. Modify in-browser cookie state

Unacceptable losses
===================

1. Loss of control-flow integrity on flowgridviz host
2. Loss of availability of flowgridviz
3. flowgridviz sends unwanted traffic to a remote host
4. flowgridviz demands too much bandwidth from a remote host
5. Harmful content appears in the end-user's browser
6. Harmful content is sent to the api user
7. Harmful content is sent to the labeling system by flowgridviz


Controls
========

Software deployment
-------------------

The software running on the flowgridviz host is from many
sources. flowgridviz itself is authored by the its authorship team,
but it depends on resources such as Amazon Linux, NodeJS, the Node
libraries listed in the package.json file, nginx, etc. Each of these
other software systems may introduce unknown and unsafe component
interactions.

Some attempts are made to control for a few of these. `yum` is used to
keep Amazon Linux updated. Node libraries are fetched using
`npm`. Each of these has controls for integrity, but neither has a
perfect track record of invulnerability. Any of these components could
lead to a loss.

flowgridviz itself is authored on author-owned computers which have
third-party software with known vulnerabilities. It is possible for
these vulnerabilities to lead to unintended code being committed to
the source code repository. Source code is managed with git. The
nature of git's change tracking algorithm is such that alterations of
code from outside of git would be detectable through hash mismatches,
but changes made by subverting an authorized author's (6) local `git`
session would not be.

In the authorship process, changes to flowgridviz are pushed to an
external git repository (Georgia Tech's github for now, the public
github eventually) and to a bare git repository on the flowgridviz
host. All of these pushes occur over authenticated connections, either
https or ssh. The author is authenticated and the contents of their
submissions are protected against tampering in transit.

On the flowgridviz host there is a second git repository that fetches
from the local bare repository in order to affect the deployed
software. In that repository, `git checkout` is used to select a
tagged version to execute. For debugging purposes a person who is both
system administrator (5) and author (6) is able to edit the running
software. These changes are rolled back by human-enforced policy.

Local Proxy and HTTP(s) traffic
----------------------------

In order to protect traffic to and from flowgridviz from unauthorized
modification, most, but not all, of its operational communications are
over HTTPS. This is achieved through the use of an nginx proxy using a
Let's Encrypt certificate. Local traffic between nginx and the node
process running flowgridviz is over HTTP on the loopback
interface. flowgridviz binds only to the configured IP address. If the
configuration is left in the default state, node will be unable to
receive traffic except over the loopback interface, and nginx will be
unable to proxy traffic except to node over that interface. Changes to
nginx or flowgridviz configuration can alter this control and make it
ineffective.

There are two intentional exceptions where unauthenticated HTTP can be
used. The first is the nginx redirect system that accepts HTTP
connections and sends back a redirection to use HTTPS. The second is
the provision that allows data to be fetched from labeling systems
over HTTP. This means that adversaries can modify both the requests
sent by flowgridviz to the labeling system, and responses sent by the
labeling system. Removing this option would improve the security of
the system.

The private keys used for TLS are stored on disk and loaded into nginx
memory. Unauthorized file system or memory access could cause these to
be lost to an adversary. Mechanisms for such access include VM-to-VM
attacks from another virtual machine on the same host, remote code
execution vulnerabilities in system services or flowgridviz, loss of
the system administrator ssh keys, etc. These risks are partially
mitigated by the short validity window of the TLS certificates.

Web Application State and Browser Protection
--------------------------------------------

No server-side session state is maintained. The flowgridviz service
uses cookies, but only set and read from within the browser, never
used by the server itself. These cookies are only used to retain user
viewing preferences and expire at the end of the browser session. Loss
of or damage to these cookies can result in unexpected rendering
glitches, but will not harm the server. The cookies can be cleared at
any time with no unacceptable loss.

HTML content served to end-users is generated using a DOM-based
template library that avoids the pitfalls of [context-sensitive
escaping](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md)
by only adding content using DOM methods. This alters the structure of
the document but does not expose adversary-controlled input to the
HTML, JavaScript, or CSS parsers. This controls for loss #5.

JSON content is similarly generated not by manual string construction,
but by the use of `JSON.stringify` on actual JavaScript objects. This
provides similar protections for JSON parsers. This controls for
losses #5 and #6.

Unauthenticated Operation
-------------------------

Most users of flowgridviz are expected to be unauthenticated end users
using a web browser to interact with the site over https. They will
interact with their browsers which will send traffic to the ngix proxy
on the flowgridviz server. TLS will be used for the browser to verify
the identity of the server, but client certificates will not be used
so the browser cannot verify the identity of the end-user.

These users can browse data that is already loaded into
flowgridviz. The system exposes endpoints for these https requests
that are designed to minimize the ability to alter server state. The
state changes in response to these unauthenticated requests are
limited to: incidental LRU cache additions and removals of
intermediate calculations used in generating responses, logging of
traffic and errors.

Of course these requests also cause the consumption of sockets between
the end-user and nginx and between nginx and the node service. It is
possible for a large volume of requests to consume sufficient file
handles on the server so as to impact availability for future
requests.

No unauthenticated requests should cause flowgridviz to issue network
connections to other systems, to write to files other that its own log
streams, or to execute other processes. In order for any of these to
occur, the incoming request would have to exploit a vulnerability
outside of the control of flowgridviz, such as by sending a malformed
HTTP request that exploits a buffer overflow in one of the parsing
libraries. flowgridviz itself does not perform these actions in
response to unauthenticated requests, to control for loss #1.

One unauthenticated end-point is able to cause flowgridviz to send
large quantities of data: namely the record downloader. Exposing this
function does create a risk that pcpviz will consume too much
bandwidth, increasing hosting costs or slowing other requests. It may
be disabled or modified to require authentication in a future release.

Many different sorts of requests can cause flowgridviz to read from
disk, including to serve static files. The code for processing these
requests limits the loading of each file type to a specific directory
and prevents the use of path-traversal characters in file names. A
more robust system would white-list file name characters. This is an
area for future work.


Authenticated Operation
-----------------------

Several of the actions flowgridviz exposes are able to alter its
state. These include adding or modifying data set definitions,
deleting data sets, or requesting data set reload. Adding, modifying,
or reloading datasets will alter the internal state of the
application, and can cause http or https requests to be issued.

Because of these factors, all of these API endpoints first verify that
the key parts of the request are A) signed by a known authorized key,
and B) that the signatures match the contents of the request. The
authentication system used is from the
[http-signature](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-10)
IETF draft. It is a work in progress, but sufficient for the needs of
flowgridviz as-is. The authentication system helps control for losses
#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, and #7.

The authorization system itself must read from disk to fetch the
identified public key. Care is taken to ensure that the key names are
sanitized, but this could be made more robust. The keys are read for
each authorization in order to allow for key revocation by file
deletion and to avoid time-of-check vs time-of-user errors.

Requests for authorization will cause expensive CPU operations to be
performed in order to complete the public-key signature
verification. Sufficiently many requests would cause a loss of
availability (loss #2). Rate limiting is a future option should this prove
problematic.

The API end points that cause requests to be issued to supposed
analysis systems could be improved in several ways. The use of https
could be enforced. An outbound request destination allow-list could be
employed. An outbound request rate limiter could be
implemented. Instead, these risks are controlled for by the
authentication barrier. Only trusted users or users who have obtained
the private keys of trusted users can trigger these requests, which
controls for losses #2, #3, #4, and #7.

The responses to requests for packet or flow data are often very
large. The parsing system is a simple state machine to control for
losses #1 and #2. The API that triggers the requests rejects any
malformed input definitions and the parser that processes the
responses rejects any malformed packet or flow data. The data types
supported are IP addresses, port numbers, label strings, and an
arbitrary textual identifier. The identifier is only exposed when
downloading the full packet/flow record set. The label strings are
operated on as a bit field expect when they are converted back to text
in the user interface. These are intended to control for losses #1,
#2, #5, #6.



Conclusion
==========

flowgridviz is designed to be uncomplicated and analyzable by
humans. No home-grown cryptography is used. TLS is used for all
end-user communication. No assumptions were made about the
trustworthiness of data loaded from any http request issued by
flowgridviz.  The largest risks remaining are caused by the
third-party dependencies. Controlling for these risks is impractical
as it would require authoring a complete operating system, networking
stack, and web application stack.

Where possible, controls have either been implemented or explicitly
rejected and documented. Choices which would increase risk were made
with great care. Many options for increased user-interface flexibility
or data ingest flexibility were rejected in order to control for the
unacceptable losses listed above. For example, the template system is
harder to use than the one that comes with the Express web application
framework, but it lacks the cross-site scripting vulnerabilities of
that framework.
