MalwareVis: Entity-based Visualization of Malware Network Traces
https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2379696 -> p41-zhuo.pdf

^

MalwareVis is another network activity visualizer. It focuses on
network flows of known-malicious software in order to better
understand the malware. The output is useful for finding other
malicious flows, but the visualization techniques themselves may not
serve as well in a mixed benign/malicious network environment.

Examines a few network data visualization shcemes for their suitability in detecting new forms of malicious traffic. Proposes an alternative port-focused methodology. Uses this methodology to find new botnet traffic.

ScanViewer is used for visially detecting network scans. It uses Parallel Coordinates, histograms, color maps, and scatterplots to visualize the same network packet capture data. Mapping between source IP and destination port is used to find nodes with high out-degree, which are performing scans.`
